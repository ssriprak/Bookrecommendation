# Bookrecommendation
Creating a book recommendation system

## Overview
This project aims to build a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques and data analysis. The project consists of multiple notebooks that cover different aspects of data exploration, model building, and evaluation.

## Notebooks
`Books Data Explorative Analysis.ipynb`
This notebook focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the books dataset. It provides insights into the data through various visualizations and statistical summaries. It includes data cleaning, preprocessing and exploration. 

`Book Recommendation System.ipynb`
This notebook contains the primary code for building and evaluating the book recommendation model. It used the tfidf method to create a search engine of sorts for the book recommendation

`Book Recommendation System - II.ipynb`
This notebook extends the work done in the first notebook, adding more advanced techniques and optimizations to improve the recommendation system.
